 Adjusted log10 to handle values less or equal to zero. <p> The logarithm does not result in real numbers for arguments less or equal to zero, but the plot should still somehow handle such values without crashing. So anything &le; 0 is mapped to a 'really big negative' number just for the sake of plotting. <p> Note that LogarithmicAxis.java in the JFreeChart has another interesting idea for modifying the log10 of values &le; 10, resulting in a smooth plot for the full real argument range. Unfortunately that clobbers values like 1e-7, which might be a very real vacuum reading.

 Returns true if the passed-in process listener is for an AIR application that has terminated. This is used by accept() in order to detect that it should give up listening on the socket. The reason we can't do this for Flash player-based apps is that unlike AIR apps, the process that we launched sometimes acts as just sort of a "launcher" process that terminates quickly, and the actual Flash player is in some other process. For example, on Mac, we often invoke the "open" program to open a web browser; and on Windows, if you launch firefox.exe but it detects that there is already a running instance of firefox.exe, the new instance will just pass a message to the old instance, and then the new instance will terminate.

 Used when accessibility capability is available to locate an occurrence of the field in the most derived class or superclass and set its  accessibility flag. Note that this method is not needed in the simple non accessible case because we don't have to hunt for fields. Note that classes may declare overlapping private fields, so the  distinction about the most derived is important.  Java doesn't normally allow this kind of access (super won't show private variables) so  there is no real syntax for specifying which class scope to use...

 Manually trigger a re-filtering of the rows of this table. If the filtering predicate concerns only items within this table, calling this method should be unnecessary. It is only when the filtering predicate references data outside of this table that a manual re-filtering request may be necessary. For example, filtering valid edges of a graph from a pool of candidate edges will depend on the available nodes.

The new elements will appear in this list in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's iterator.
 Overridden to return false, and if the event is a mouse event it is forwarded to the tree.<p> The behavior for this is debatable, and should really be offered as a property. By returning false, all keyboard actions are implemented in terms of the table. By returning true, the tree would get a chance to do something with the keyboard events. For the most part this is ok. But for certain keys, such as left/right, the tree will expand/collapse where as the table focus should really move to a different column. Page up/down should also be implemented in terms of the table. By returning false this also has the added benefit that clicking outside of the bounds of the tree node, but still in the tree column will select the row, whereas if this returned true that wouldn't be the case. <p>By returning false we are also enforcing the policy that the tree will never be editable (at least by a key sequence).

 The start configuration for simplex is built from a box parallel to the canonical axes of the space. The simplex is the subset of vertices of a box parallel to the canonical axes. It is built as the path followed while traveling from one vertex of the box to the diagonally opposite vertex moving only along the box edges. The first vertex of the box will be located at the start point of the optimization. As an example, in dimension 3 a simplex has 4 vertices. Setting the steps to (1, 10, 2) and the start point to (1, 1, 1) would imply the start simplex would be: { (1, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1), (2, 11, 1), (2, 11, 3) }. The first vertex would be set to the start point at (1, 1, 1) and the last vertex would be set to the diagonally opposite vertex at (2, 11, 3).

The substrings in the stream are in the order in which they occur in the input. Trailing empty strings will be discarded and not encountered in the stream. <p> If the given pattern does not match any subsequence of the input then the resulting stream has just one element, namely the input sequence in string form. <p> When there is a positive-width match at the beginning of the input sequence then an empty leading substring is included at the beginning of the stream. A zero-width match at the beginning however never produces such empty leading substring. <p> If the input sequence is mutable, it must remain constant from the stream creation until the execution of the terminal stream operation. Otherwise, the result of the terminal stream operation is undefined.

 Appends an SQL string to the given StringBuilder, including the opening and closing single quotes. Any single quotes internal to sqlString will be escaped. This method is deprecated because we want to encourage everyone to use the "?" binding form.  However, when implementing a ContentProvider, one may want to add WHERE clauses that were not provided by the caller.  Since "?" is a positional form, using it in this case could break the caller because the indexes would be shifted to accomodate the ContentProvider's internal bindings.  In that case, it may be necessary to construct a WHERE clause manually.  This method is useful for those cases.

 Description of the Method
 Modify vec so the line mapping nl it represents is related to the original line mapping ol by nl[c] = IF c < col THEN ol[c] ELSE ol[c] + incr.  In other words, if adding n characters (or removing -incr  characters) before the character in column c, then call adjustMappingPairVector(c, n, ...).  However, if replacing  a token of length blen at column c by an expression of length nlen, then call adjustMappingPairVector(c+1, nlen - olen, ...) because: (a) the beginning position of the expression is the same as that of the token, and (b) one should never be looking at or modifying anything inside the expression, so we can call adjustMappingPairVector with any first argument between c+1 and c+(length of original token).

 Gets the gap between this interval and another interval. The other interval can be either before or after this interval. <p> Intervals are inclusive of the start instant and exclusive of the end. An interval has a gap to another interval if there is a non-zero duration between them. This method returns the amount of the gap only if the intervals do actually have a gap between them. If the intervals overlap or abut, then null is returned. <p> When two intervals are compared the result is one of three states: (a) they abut, (b) there is a gap between them, (c) they overlap. The abuts state takes precedence over the other two, thus a zero duration interval at the start of a larger interval abuts and does not overlap. <p> The chronology of the returned interval is the same as that of this interval (the chronology of the interval parameter is not used). Note that the use of the chronology was only correctly implemented in version 1.3.

 Adds all the rules to this RuleSet from the given other rule set.
 Appends a default value for a field to the formatter for use in parsing. <p> This appends an instruction to the builder to inject a default value into the parsed result. This is especially useful in conjunction with optional parts of the formatter. <p> For example, consider a formatter that parses the year, followed by an optional month, with a further optional day-of-month. Using such a formatter would require the calling code to check whether a full date, year-month or just a year had been parsed. This method can be used to default the month and day-of-month to a sensible value, such as the first of the month, allowing the calling code to always get a date. <p> During formatting, this method has no effect. <p> During parsing, the current state of the parse is inspected. If the specified field has no associated value, because it has not been parsed successfully at that point, then the specified value is injected into the parse result. Injection is immediate, thus the field-value pair will be visible to any subsequent elements in the formatter. As such, this method is normally called at the end of the builder.

 Build mapping tables based on the line count of  the given source string. These tables allow us to compute starting and  ending locations of each line of the source file. The assumption using this technique is that most lines of the source files will never be accessed  thus we only incur the overhead of 8 bytes  (start & end) per line, plus the actual string  contents each line a line is requested. Thus we need  8 * num_files * num_lines_per_file bytes for all these maps. For example, say each file is 1000 lines and we have 400 source files;  We would consume 3.2MB.  With  each request we would allocate an additional 20+ bytes for the string (assuming a 20B avg line length). Allocating each line individually we would consume 1000 * 400 * 20 = 8MB. It is debatable whether this scheme is more efficient than actually builing an array of Strings to contain the lines, but gut feel says it is ;)

 (Try to) trim the pool until its total space falls below the max size (soft cap). This will get rid of values on the free list, until the free lists are empty, or we fall below the max size; whichever comes first. NOTE: It is NOT an error if we have eliminated all the free values, but the pool is still above its max size (soft cap) <p> The approach we take is to go from the smallest sized bucket down to the largest sized bucket. This may seem a bit counter-intuitive, but the rationale is that allocating larger-sized values is more expensive than the smaller-sized ones, so we want to keep them around for a while.

 Returns the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed float value between 0.0 and 1.0 from this random number generator's sequence. The general contract of nextFloat is that one float value, chosen (approximately) uniformly from the range 0.0f (inclusive) to 1.0f (exclusive), is pseudorandomly generated and returned. All 224 possible float values of the form mx&nbsp2-24, where m is a positive integer less than 224 , are produced with (approximately) equal probability. The method nextFloat is implemented by class Random as follows: public float nextFloat() { return next(24) / ((float)(1 << 24)); } The hedge "approximately" is used in the foregoing description only because the next method is only approximately an unbiased source of independently chosen bits. If it were a perfect source or randomly chosen bits, then the algorithm shown would choose float values from the stated range with perfect uniformity. [In early versions of Java, the result was incorrectly calculated as: return next(30) / ((float)(1 << 30)); This might seem to be equivalent, if not better, but in fact it introduced a slight nonuniformity because of the bias in the rounding of floating-point numbers: it was slightly more likely that the low-order bit of the significand would be 0 than that it would be 1.]

 Check the integrity of our data structures. Scan the known intersections. Note intersections with no roads. Scan the roads of the intersection: Each road has two intersections. If the road has already been encountered, then we recorded its "other" intersection and that must match this intersection. If it doesn't match, record an error. If it does match reset its recorded other intersection to be a special marker indicating that both ends of the road have been accounted for. If the road has not already been encountered, then record its "other" intersection. Scan the known roads. Every road should accounted for in the "other" intersection table and should be marked as having both intersections accounted for. Note the roads which were not found in the first scan and the roads which were found, but for which both intersections were not found. Remark every road. Finally scan the other intersection table for entries which were not marked as being in the roads vector.

 This method lists the entries of the current working directory parsing the reply to a FTP LIST command. The response to the LIST command is parsed through the FTPListParser objects registered on the client. The distribution of ftp4j contains some standard parsers already registered on every FTPClient object created. If they don't work in your case (a FTPListParseException is thrown), you can build your own parser implementing the FTPListParser interface and add it to the client by calling its addListParser() method. Calling this method blocks the current thread until the operation is completed. The operation could be interrupted by another thread calling abortCurrentDataTransfer(). The list() method will break with a FTPAbortedException.

 Encode char array to UTF-8 byte array, with SQL escape. Driver exchange with server use exclusively UTF-8 and lot of parameters are string. Most the time spend using driver is spend transforming String parameters in UTF-8 escaped bytes. Every String as to be escaped to avoid SQL injection, so whe must loop through the String char array to add escape chars, creating a new char array, and after decoding this char array to UTF-8 bytes. Using standard java, this result in : - recreating a lot of char array (and copy to new array) during escape. - utf-8 encoding is using internally a byte array initialized to 3 * the char length and will be spliced when final length is known. when dealing with big string, that is using a lot of array for nothing (and so memory issues) Resulting byte array will be send to outputStream, so : - escape characters are ASCII characters (one byte) -> the escaped characters can be put directly in array - driver don't need the final byte array shrink, the byte array can be send directly in outputStream. Example for a 1k character String : if using standard java - getting toCharArray() will create a new 1k char array (and copy existing array into it). - escaping (using a StringBuffer) will use a new 1k char array and the internal array may expand (=> new allocation + copy) if there is any char to be escape - getBytes("UTF-8") : a new 3k byte buffer will be created, and finally a new one (+copy into it) when real length is known. Current implementation : - creating a 3k bytes array, send directly these array with length into outputStream. => only one array.

 Construct a string representing a byte array.  Use run-length encoding. Two bytes are packed into a single char, with a single extra zero byte at the end if needed.  A byte represents itself, unless it is the ESCAPE_BYTE.  Then the following notations are possible: ESCAPE_BYTE ESCAPE_BYTE   ESCAPE_BYTE literal ESCAPE_BYTE n b           n instances of byte b Since an encoded run occupies 3 bytes, we only encode runs of 4 or more bytes.  Thus we have n > 0 and n != ESCAPE_BYTE and n <= 0xFF. If we encounter a run where n == ESCAPE_BYTE, we represent this as: b ESCAPE_BYTE n-1 b The ESCAPE_BYTE value is chosen so as not to collide with commonly seen values.

 Method for invoking a known database prepared statement to compress a designated table.  Typically this is done after a nontrivial number of deletions from a table have occurred, and the current database implementation is know to be a lazy space reclaimer (e.g., Derby). NOTES:  At this time, Apache Derby is the database implementation in use, and Derby has a few important "oh by the way(s)": 1) Either of the prepared statements: SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE( ) SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE( ) should be called in autocommit mode. This should already be so for a new Connection, by default, but as a formality, we ensure it.  Since we will not reuse the Connection object, we will not worry about restoration. 2) See the Derby documentation for discussion of the <short> parameters to these prepared statements.  They have important consequences for the type and duration of processing which occurs. 3) In practice, SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE() seems to incur deadlock with concurrent Anomaly Detection Engine Analyze processing (and perhaps others, as well), whereas SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE() does not seem to. The scoping of this method and the default ("in place == true") reflects the fact that only the in-place form is trusted by Anomaly Detection Engine at this time (and so this is currently the only way it is offered publicly).  Note also that both prepared statements acquire an exclusive table lock for their duration.  Experience shows that explicit acquisition beforehand does not seem to provide any help in avoiding deadlock (contrary to any internet testimonials one may find).

 Returns dividend - divisor * n, where n is the mathematical integer closest to dividend/divisor. If dividend/divisor is equally close to surrounding integers, we choose n to be the integer of smallest magnitude, which makes this treatment differ from Math.IEEEremainder(double,double), where n is chosen to be the even integer. Note that the choice of n is not done considering the double approximation of dividend/divisor, because it could cause result to be outside [-|divisor|/2,|divisor|/2] range. The practical effect is that if multiple results would be possible, we always choose the result that is the closest to (and has the same sign as) the dividend. Ex. : - for (-3.0,2.0), this method returns -1.0, whereas Math.IEEEremainder returns 1.0. - for (-5.0,2.0), both this method and Math.IEEEremainder return -1.0. If the remainder is zero, its sign is the same as the sign of the first argument. If either argument is NaN, or the first argument is infinite, or the second argument is positive zero or negative zero, then the result is NaN. If the first argument is finite and the second argument is infinite, then the result is the same as the first argument. NB: - Modulo operator (%) returns a value in ]-|divisor|,|divisor|[, which sign is the same as dividend. - As for modulo operator, the sign of the divisor has no effect on the result. - On some architecture, % operator has been observed to return NaN for some subnormal values of divisor, when dividend exponent is 1023, which impacts the correctness of this method.

 Checks next page exists or not. If there is a valid entry in searchAfter result, this returns true. If searchAfter result is empty or entries are all invalid(expired, etc), this returns false. For example, let's say there are 5 docs. doc=1,2,5 are valid and doc=3,4 are expired(invalid). When limit=2, the first page shows doc=1,2. In this logic, searchAfter will first fetch doc=3,4 but they are invalid(filtered out in `processQueryResults`). Next iteration will hit doc=5 and it is a valid entry. Therefore, it returns true. If doc=1,2 are valid and doc=3,4,5 are invalid, then searchAfter will hit doc=3,4 and doc=5. However, all entries are invalid. This returns false indicating there is no next page.

 Compares two strings lexicographically. The comparison is based on the Unicode value of each character in the strings. The character sequence represented by this String object is compared lexicographically to the character sequence represented by the argument string. The result is a negative integer if this String object lexicographically precedes the argument string. The result is a positive integer if this String object lexicographically follows the argument string. The result is zero if the strings are equal; compareTo returns 0 exactly when the method would return true. This is the definition of lexicographic ordering. If two strings are different, then either they have different characters at some index that is a valid index for both strings, or their lengths are different, or both. If they have different characters at one or more index positions, let k be the smallest such index; then the string whose character at position k has the smaller value, as determined by using the < operator, lexicographically precedes the other string. In this case, compareTo returns the difference of the two character values at position k in the two string -- that is, the value: this.charAt(k)-anotherString.charAt(k) If there is no index position at which they differ, then the shorter string lexicographically precedes the longer string. In this case, compareTo returns the difference of the lengths of the strings -- that is, the value: this.length()-anotherString.length()

 Retrieve the contents of a record into a user-supplied buffer array. Used to reduce addressing overhead when code will access several columns of the record.
 Attempt to recover from a syntax error.  This returns false if recovery  fails, true if it succeeds.  Recovery happens in 4 steps.  First we pop the parse stack down to a point at which we have a shift out of the top-most state on the error Symbol.  This represents the initial error recovery configuration.  If no such configuration is found, then we fail.  Next a small number of "lookahead" or "parse ahead" Symbols are read into a buffer.  The size of this buffer is  determined by error_sync_size() and determines how many Symbols beyond the error must be matched to consider the recovery a success.  Next,  we begin to discard Symbols in attempt to get past the point of error to a point where we can continue parsing.  After each Symbol, we attempt  to "parse ahead" though the buffered lookahead Symbols.  The "parse ahead" process simulates that actual parse, but does not modify the real  parser's configuration, nor execute any actions. If we can  parse all  the stored Symbols without error, then the recovery is considered a  success.  Once a successful recovery point is determined, we do an actual parse over the stored input -- modifying the real parse  configuration and executing all actions.  Finally, we return the the  normal parser to continue with the overall parse.

 Format method for the d conversion character and long argument. <p/> For d format, the flag character '-', means that the output should be left justified within the field.  The default is to pad with blanks on the left.  A '+' character means that the conversion will always begin with a sign (+ or -).  The blank flag character means that a non-negative input will be preceded with a blank.  If both a '+' and a ' ' are specified, the blank flag is ignored.  The '0' flag character implies that padding to the field width will be done with zeros instead of blanks. <p/> The field width is treated as the minimum number of characters to be printed.  The default is to add no padding.  Padding is with blanks by default. <p/> The precision, if set, is the minimum number of digits to appear.  Padding is with leading 0s.

 Internal -- push the global variables from the Stylesheet onto the context's runtime variable stack. <p>If we encounter a variable that is already defined in the variable stack, we ignore it.  This is because the second variable definition will be at a lower import precedence.  Presumably, global"variables at the same import precedence with the same name will have been caught during the recompose process. <p>However, if we encounter a parameter that is already defined in the variable stack, we need to see if this is a parameter whose value was supplied by a setParameter call.  If so, we need to "receive" the one already in the stack, ignoring this one.  If it is just an earlier xsl:param or xsl:variable definition, we ignore it using the same reasoning as explained above for the variable.

Other than that, any semantic checks can be specified and do not need to stay the same from version to version. A readObject method of this form may be added to any class, even if Tetrad sessions were previously saved out using a version of the class that didn't include it. (That's what the "s.defaultReadObject();" is for. See J. Bloch, Effective Java, for help.

 This is the entry point for extracting k-best hypotheses. It computes all of them, writing the results to the BufferedWriter passed in. If you want intermediate access to the k-best derivations, you'll want to call getKthHyp() or getKthDerivation() directly. The number of derivations that are looked for is controlled by the `top-n` parameter. Note that when `top-n` is set to 0, k-best extraction is disabled entirely, and only things  like the viterbi string and the model score are available to the decoder. Since k-best extraction involves the recomputation of features to get the component values, turning off that extraction saves a lot of time when only the 1-best string is desired.

 The real work of making the state table deterministic happens here.  This function merges a state in the state table (specified by rowNum) with a state that is passed in (newValues).  The basic process is to copy the nonzero cells in newStates into the state in the state table (we'll call that oldValues).  If there's a collision (i.e., if the same cell has a nonzero value in both states, and it's not the SAME value), then we have to reconcile the collision.  We do this by creating a new state, adding it to the end of the state table, and using this function recursively to merge the original two states into a single, combined state.  This process may happen recursively (i.e., each successive level may involve collisions).  To prevent infinite recursion, we keep a log of merge operations.  Any time we're merging two states we've merged before, we can just supply the row number for the result of that merge operation rather than creating a new state just like it.

 The number of partitions is calculated based on two parameters. First, there is a minumum number of datapoints per task, which is considered a hard limit. This means, we generate *at most* (totalPointsInRange/minDatapointsPerTask) tasks. The second parameter is the numTasks parameter, which tells us the "desired" number of tasks.  The number of subranges is then defined as follows: - If the desired number of tasks is larger than the hard limit, we choose the hard limit - Otherwise, we choose the desired number of tasks Effectively, this means choosing the smaller of the two values (MIN), while making sure that the value returned is >= 1.

 Creates a set of offset/span pairs specifying how to lay out a set of components with the specified alignments. The resulting span allocations will overlap, with each one fitting as well as possible into the given total allocation. This method requires that you specify the total amount of space to be allocated, the size requirements for each component to be placed (specified as an array of SizeRequirements), and the total size requirements of the set of components (only the alignment field of which is actually used) You can get the total size requirement by invoking getAlignedSizeRequirements. This method also requires a flag indicating whether normal or reverse alignment should be performed.  With normal alignment the value 0.0f represents the left/top edge of the component to be aligned.  With reverse alignment, 0.0f represents the right/bottom edge.

 Main deletion method. Locates node, nulls value, appends a deletion marker, unlinks predecessor, removes associated index nodes, and possibly reduces head index level. Index nodes are cleared out simply by calling findPredecessor. which unlinks indexes to deleted nodes found along path to key, which will include the indexes to this node.  This is done unconditionally. We can't check beforehand whether there are index nodes because it might be the case that some or all indexes hadn't been inserted yet for this node during initial search for it, and we'd like to ensure lack of garbage retention, so must call to be sure.

 All the logic here is used to determine by what factor the paper view should be folded in response to the user's touch events. The logic here uses vertical scrolling to fold a vertically oriented view and horizontal scrolling to fold a horizontally oriented fold. Depending on where the anchor point of the fold is, movements towards or away from the anchor point will either fold or unfold the paper respectively. The translation logic here also accounts for the touch slop when a new user touch begins, but before a scroll event is first invoked.
